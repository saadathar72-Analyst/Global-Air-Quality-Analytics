# 🌟 Global Air Quality Analytics — Insights & Recommendations

## 🔹 Key Insights
1. **Major Pollutants:** PM2.5 and NO₂ are the primary contributors to high AQI levels globally.  
2. **Top Polluted Regions:** India, China, and Pakistan consistently show the highest AQI values.  
3. **Pollutant Correlations:** Analysis revealed 4 key correlations:
   - PM2.5 ↔ Overall AQI  
   - NO₂ ↔ Overall AQI  
   - CO ↔ Overall AQI  
   - Ozone ↔ NO₂  
4. **City-Level Trends:** Certain urban areas exhibit consistently higher AQI due to traffic, industrial activity, and population density.  
5. **Seasonal/Temporal Patterns:** (If dataset has time dimension) AQI peaks during winter months in several regions due to weather and emissions.

## 🔹 Recommendations
1. **Policy Measures:** Focus on reducing PM2.5 and NO₂ emissions through stricter industrial and vehicular regulations.  
2. **Urban Planning:** Monitor highly polluted cities and implement green zones, improved traffic management, and air purifiers in public spaces.  
3. **Public Awareness:** Encourage citizen-level initiatives like carpooling, use of public transport, and indoor air filtration.  
4. **Data Monitoring:** Maintain real-time air quality monitoring stations for timely alerts and trend analysis.  
5. **Future Analysis:** Extend the dataset to include meteorological data to study the effect of temperature, wind, and humidity on AQI.

## 🔹 Future Scope
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use historical AQI and pollutant data to forecast future air quality levels.  
- **Machine Learning Insights:** Predict AQI categories based on pollutant levels using Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.  
- **Interactive Web Dashboard:** Extend Power BI insights into a web application for public access.  
- **Global Comparison:** Compare AQI trends across continents and identify global high-risk zones.
